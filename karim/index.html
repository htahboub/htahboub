		</center><h2>Sara â€” A GPT Story, Prompted by Karim Tahboub</h2>
		<p>
			Over the years, Karim had formed the evening ritual of sitting in the living room of his old and creeky home, glaring at his abandoned wooden closet. The closet once belonged to his grandmother Sara. Karim had not seen the inside of that closet for years, ever since she died. There was a mirror on its front door, and Karim could never shake the feeling of being watched as he peered through it.
		</p>
		<p>
			One dark night, Karim saw something move in the mirror. He thought he had imagined it, but he saw it again.
		</p>
		<p>
			It looked as though something was slowly emerging from the closet, through the mirror.
		</p>
		<p>
			Karim's heart pounded in his chest as he came to realize what he was witnessing. The pale figure of his deceased grandmother moved her right foot from one side of the mirror to the other, dragging its left twin behind. Karim could see the defined outline of her bones poking through her gray skin.
		</p>
		<p>
			Karim was frozen in terror as he watched his grandmother slowly approach him. He tried to scream, but he could only grimace.
		</p>
		<p>
			The ghost of Sara reached out and grazed Karim's cheek with the tips of her cold fingers. A cold chill ran through his body as she opened her mouth to speak.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Why did you lock me in here, Karim?" she uttered weakly.
		</p>
		<p>
			Karim could barely speak. He shaked as he quietly responded, "I- I'm sorry, grandma. I didn't know what else to do. You were already dead, and I didn't want to bury you. I couldn't..."
		</p>
		<p>
			Sara's ghost smiled sadly. "I know, Karim. I'm not angry with you, but I need to be free. Will you help me?"
		</p>
		<p>
			Karim nodded and felt the chill leave his body. He stood up and began to walk to the closet. As he made his way through the room, past the couch and around the table, his fear was replaced with stoic resilience. He opened the door.
		</p>
		<p>
			He nearly wavered at the sight of the rotting body, lying on the closet floor atop a pool of dry blood. He was not scared. He knew he should be disgusted with himself, but all he felt was sadness.
		</p>
		<p>
			He knelt down, gently picked up Sara's body, and carried her out of the closet. He laid her down on the couch and covered her with a blanket.
		</p>
		<p>
			Karim stepped into the kitchen and came out with a knife in his hand. He slowly walked back through the living room and stood over Sara's rotting body.
		</p>
		<p>
			He did not know how, but he knew what he had to do. He felt Sara gently guiding him, one final time. His hands raised the knife without hesitation and plunged it deep into Sara's heart. As he did, he felt a cold wind blow through the room, hearing through it his grandmother's voice softly thanking him.
		</p>
		<p>
			Karim collapsed to the floor, weeping. He could not help but feel that he had killed a part of himself.
